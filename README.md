## Style Transfer Methods Explained

| Method                   | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Neural Style Transfer (NST) | Uses a training loop to directly optimize an output image to match style and content. Highly flexible. |
| Fast Neural Style Transfer     | Fast and efficient ‚Äî but each style requires a separate pre-trained model. Ideal for real-time applications. |

The current app uses **Fast Neural Style Transfer**, trained in PyTorch on Google Colab.
